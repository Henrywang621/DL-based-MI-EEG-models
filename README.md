# An in-depth survey on deep learning-based MI EEG Classification

This project aims to investigate the existing deep learning-based MI EEG decoding models, including representative network architectures, input formulations, public datasets, commonly-used metrics, performance evaluation of the representative models and the analysis of the models. I will update this repository regularly.
